# linux-kernel-networking-stack

In this project, I'm going to evaluate the performance of the Linux kernel's network functions in two parts: send flow and receive flow, using eBPF.

- What is tracing
- Introduction to eBPF and bpftrace  
- The Linux kernel's networking stack  
- Measuring latency of sending network packets  
- Measuring latency of receiving network packets
